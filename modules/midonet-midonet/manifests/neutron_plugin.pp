# == Class: midonet::neutron_plugin
#
# Install and configure Midonet Neutron Plugin. Please note that manifest does
# install Neutron (because it is a requirement of
# 'python-neutron-plugin-midonet' package) but it does not configure it nor run
# it. It just configure the specific midonet plugin files. It is supposed to be
# deployed along any existing puppet module  that configures Neutron, such as
# puppetlabs/neutron
#
# === Parameters
#
# [*midonet_api_ip*]
#   IP address of the midonet api service
# [*username*]
#   Username from which midonet api will authenticate against Keystone (use
#   neutron service username)
# [*password*]
#   Password from which midonet api will authenticate against Keystone (use
#   neutron service password)
# [*project_id*]
#   Tenant from which midonet api will authenticate against Keystone (use
#   neutron service tenant)
#
# === Examples
#
# The easiest way to run this class is:
#
#    include midonet::neutron_plugin
#
# Although it is quite useless: it assumes that there is a Neutron server already
# configured and a MidoNet API running localhost with Mock authentication.
#
# A more advanced call would be:
#
#     class {'midonet::neutron_plugin':
#         midonet_api_ip => '23.123.5.32',
#         username       => 'neutron',
#         password       => '32kjaxT0k3na',
#         project_id     => 'service'
#     }
#
# You can alternatively use the Hiera's yaml style:
#     midonet::neutron_plugin::midonet_api_ip: '23.213.5.32'
#     midonet::neutron_plugin::username: 'neutron'
#     midonet::neutron_plugin::password: '32.kjaxT0k3na'
#     midonet::neutron_plugin::midonet_api_ip: 'service'
#
